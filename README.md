# Anonymous Broadcast from Lattice Assumptions

Code accompannying the paper "Anonymous Broadcast from Lattice Assumptions"

Depedencies are the [NFLlib](https://github.com/quarkslab/NFLlib) and [FLINT](https://flintlib.org/doc/) 2.8 libraries.
NFLLib is already included in this repository, but instructions for installing its dependencies can be found in the link above.
FLINT is usually included in package managers and can be easily installed in most systems out there.

### Building dependencies

To build NFLLib, run the following inside a cloned version of this repository:

```
$ mkdir deps
$ cd deps
$ cmake ../NFLlib -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNFL_OPTIMIZED=ON
$ make
$ make test
```
### Building and running the code

For building the actual code, run `makeÂ´` inside the source directory. This will build the binaries for `bdlop` (commitment); `bgv` and `ghl` (encryption); `pior`, `pibdn` and `linear` for proofs; and `ks` (key scheduling) for two values of N, as described in the paper. Suffix `1` is for N = 1024, and suffix `2` is for larger N = 10,000.

The binaries respectively implement the commitment scheme, the distributed BGV/GHL cryptosystems, the three zero-knowledge proofs and the key scheduling. Tests and benchmarks are included for each of them, such that they can be used independently. NFLlib is quite memory-hungry due to being a template library, so we recommend to adjust the stack size with `ulimit -s unlimited` to avoid crashing in the largest benchmarks.

__WARNING__: This is an academic proof of concept, and in particular has not received code review. This implementation is NOT ready for any type of production use.
